Hello everyone,

## Who am I?

I am a technology enthusiast from Brazil. My first experience with programming began back in 2013 with GameMaker. However, it wasn’t until 2021 that I started diving deeper into programming, focusing on Python. You can check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/joserodriguesjr) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joserodriguesjr/).

## Technical Skills and Interests

My background includes experience in web development and data science. Currently, I'm toying with embedded systems field because I enjoy understanding how things work at a deeper level.

My preferred tech stacks for development are Java with Spring and Python with FastAPI. For low-level there's no running away from C/C++, but Rust is nice tool gaining traction.

## Why this Blog?

I work on many projects using different technologies, and sometimes things get lost quickly. Since I enjoy writing and sharing knowledge, I’ll be documenting my projects here for others to see and learn from.

## Outside of Tech

In my free time, I enjoy hitting the gym, playing Rocket League, and reading mangas. They help to keep my mind sharp. \
Here are some manga recommendations: The Breaker, The Beginning After The End, To Your Eternity

## Collaboration 

If you have ideas for projects or if you’re interested in collaborating, don’t hesitate to reach out.

That's all about me.
